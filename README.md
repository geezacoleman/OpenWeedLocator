# OpenWeedLocator

Welcome to the OpenWeedLocator (OWL) project, an opensource hardware and software weed detector that uses
entirely off-the-shelf componentry, very simple green-detection algorithms (with capacity to upgrade to
in-crop detection) and 3D printable parts. OWL integrates weed detection on a Raspberry Pi with a relay
control board or custom driver board, in a custom designed case so you can attach any 12V solenoid, relay, lightbulb or 
device for low-cost, simple and open-source site-specific weed control. Projects to date have seen OWL mounted on robots,
vehicles and bicycles for spot spraying. For the latest ideas and news, check out the [Discussion](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/discussions) tab.

### Official Publications

#### OpenWeedLocator (OWL): An open-source, low-cost device for fallow weed detection

This is the original OWL publication, released
in [Scientific Reports (open access)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03858-9). A range of green detection
algorithms were tested including ExG (excess green 2g - r - b, developed by Woebbecke et al. 1995), a hue, saturation
and value (HSV) threshold and a combined ExG + HSV algorithm. If you use the OWL in your research please consider citing
this publication.

#### Investigating image-based fallow weed detection performance on Raphanus sativus and Avena sativa at speeds up to 30 km/h

The performance of the OWL from 5 - 30 km/h with different cameras and on broadleaf and grass 'weeds' was tested and
published
in [Computers and Electronics in Agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169923008074). The
current Raspberry Pi HQ Camera + latest software combination provided a recall of 74.8% at 5 km/h and 50.5 % at 30 km/h.
Recall of up to 95.7% at 5 km/h was achieved by the global shutter Arducam AR0234.

# OWL Use Cases

## Vehicle-mounted spot spraying

The first, and most clear use case for the OWL is for the site-specific application of herbicide in fallow. As part of
the development and testing of the unit, the OWL team designed and assembled a 2 m spot spraying boom, using two OWLs to
control four 12 V solenoids each. The boom was mounted on the back of a ute/utility vehicle with the spray tank located
in the tray and powered by a 12V car battery. Indicator lights for each nozzle were used to highlight more clearly when
each solenoid had been activated for demonstration and testing purposes.

</p>

Parameter | Details | Notes 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------: |:-------------------------:
Mounting gap | 0 cm | Mounted directly to same bar as nozzles, just 32cm higher.
Forward Speed | 6 - 8 km/h | Image blur/activation time limiting forward speed. Moving the OWL unit forward would be a quick improvement for travel speed and large green weeds.
Solenoids | Goyen solenoid 3QH/3662 with Teejet body | Many alternatives exist as outlined in [#2](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/issues/2)
Spray tips | Teejet TP4003E-SS | 40 degree, flat fan nozzles, stainless steel
Strainer | TeeJet 50 mesh strainer | Protect spray tip from clogging/damage
Pump/tank | Northstar 12V 60L ATV Sprayer | 8.3 LPM 12V pump, 60L capacity, tray mounted

## Robot-mounted spot spraying

A second system, identical to the first, was developed for the University of Sydney's Digifarm robot, the Agerris
Digital Farm Hand. The system is in frequent use for the site-specific control of weeds in trial areas. It is powered by
the 24V system on the robot, using a 24 - 12V DC/DC converter.

## Image data collection

The OWL can act as a high quality image data collection tool for developing image data training sets in realistic 
agricultural environments, attached to agricultural equipment. The approach allows whole-image, cropped-to-bounding-box 
and square images saved on a set frequency to a thumb drive.

Settings are updated in the `config.ini` file.

| **Method**  | **Code** | **Example** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Whole image  | 'whole' | ![20220714-145951__frame_420](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/178902742-45952737-ee3e-4a36-b9b3-216a19e78eb7.png) |

## Hardware Assembly
Separate guides are provided for the Original OWL assembly and the Compact OWL.

### Required tools
* Wire strippers
* Wire cutters
* Pliers
* Soldering iron/solder (only for Original OWL)

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ All components listed above are relatively "plug and play" with minimal soldering or complex electronics required.
Follow these instructions carefully and triple check your connections before powering anything on to avoid losing
the [magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) and potentially a few hundred dollars. Never make changes
to the wiring on the detection unit while it is connected to 12V and always remain within the safe operating voltages of
any component.

## Original OWL - Hardware Assembly

A [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZqNKogzz8k) is available for the Original OWL assembly.

Before starting, have a look at the complete wiring diagram below to see how everything fits together. The LEDs, fuse and Bulgin connector are all mounted on the rear of the OWL unit, rather than where they are located in the diagram. If you prefer not to use or can't access a Bulgin connector, there is a separate 3D model design that uses cable glands instead.

![wiring diagram-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40649348/156698009-a58ed01b-258f-462a-9524-ba3f8d7ec246.png)

### Step 1 - enclosure and mounts

Assembling the components for an OWL unit requires the enclosure and mounts as a minimum. These can be 3D printed on
your own printer or printed and delivered from one of the many online stores that offer a 3D printing service.
Alternatively, you could create your own enclosure using a plastic electrical box and cutting holes in it, if that's
easier. We'll be assuming you have printed out the enclosure and associated parts for the rest of the guide, but please
share your finished designs however they turn out!

The first few steps don't require the enclosure so you can make a start right away, but while you're working on getting
that assembled, make sure you have the pieces printing, they'll be used from Step 4. For a complete device, you'll need:
1 x base, 1 x cover, 1 x RPi mount, 1 x relay mount, 1 x regulator mount, 1 x camera mount and 1 x plug.

### Step 2 - soldering

There are only a few components that need soldering, including the fuse and voltage regulator:

* Soldering of voltage regulator pins
* Soldering of 12V input wires to voltage regulator pins
* Soldering of 5V output wires to voltage regulator pins (micro USB cable)
* Soldering of red wire to both fuse terminals

Carefully check which pins on the voltage regulator correspond to 12V in, GND in, 5V out and GND out prior to soldering.

To solder the Micro USB cable to the voltage regulator output, you'll need to cut off the USB A end so you are left with
approximately 10cm of cable. Using the wire strippers or a sharp box cutter/knife, remove the rubber sheath around the
wires. If you have a data + charging cable you should see red, green, white and black wires. The charging only cables
will likely only have the red and black wires. Isolate the red (+5V) and black (GND) wires and strip approximately 5mm
off the end. Solder the red wire to the positive output on the voltage regulator and black wire to the GND pin. Once you
have finished, it should look like the first panel in the figure below.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ Soldering can burn you and generates potentially hazardous smoke! Use appropriate care, fume extractors and
PPE to avoid any injury. If you're new to soldering, read
through [this guide](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/), which explains in more detail how to perfect your
skills and solder safely.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ When soldering, it's best to cover the exposed terminals with glue lined heat shrink to reduce the risk of
electrical short circuits.

Once the two red wires are soldered to the fuse, the fuse can be mounted on the rear panel of the OWL base. One wire
will be connected to the Bulgin plug (next step) and the other to the Wago 2-way block.

For neater wiring you can also solder jumpers between all the normally open (NO) pins on the base of the relay board,
but this is optional. If you don't solder these connections, make sure you connect wire using the screw terminals
instead. Photos of both are provided below.

![Relayboardunderside](https://media.github.sydney.edu.au/user/5402/files/e5938500-cf6c-11eb-91a2-75685a6d948d) | ![Relayboardalternative](https://media.github.sydney.edu.au/user/5402/files/e88e7580-cf6c-11eb-8e26-7bbce2fb3f71)

The other wires requiring soldering are joins between the buzzer and jumper wires for easy connection to the GPIO pins
and from the LEDs to the power in/jumper wires.

### Step 3 - wiring up Bulgin connector

Next we'll need to wire the output relay control and input 12V wires to the Bulgin panel mount connector. Fortunately
all pins are labelled, so follow the wire number table below. This will need to be repeated for the Bulgin plug as well,
which will connect your solenoids or other devices to the relay control board.

The process is:

1. Connect all wires to Bulgin connector using the screw terminals
2. Mount the connector to the rear panel
3. Leave at least 10cm of wire so it can be connected to the relay board and other connections later.

Bulgin terminal number | Wire connection
:-------------: | :-------------: 
1 | Blue wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 1
2 | Green wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 2
3 | Orange wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 3
4 | White wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 4
5 | Red 12VDC - connects to fuse wire already soldered. Make sure wire is the right length when mounted. 
6 | Black GND - connects to Wago 2-way terminal

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ Skip this step if you're using cable glands.

Once all the wires have been connected you can now mount the Bulgin connector to the OWL base.

### Step 4 - mounting the relay control board and voltage regulator

Attach the relay control board to the 3D printed relay control board mount using 2.5 mm standoffs. Attach the voltage
regulator to the 3D printed voltage regulator mount with 2 mm standoffs. The mounted voltage regulator can then be
mounted to one corner of the relay control board. The relay board and voltage regulator can then be installed in the
raised slots in the OWL base.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ Use **2.5 mm** standoffs for mounting the relay control board to its base. Use **2 mm** standoffs to mount the
voltage regulator to its base.

![Relaymount](https://media.github.sydney.edu.au/user/5402/files/964c5500-cf6a-11eb-8d2f-e1282b6411c3)

### Step 5 - wiring the relay control board, voltage regulator, Wago 2-way blocks and Bulgin connector

Connect the relay control board to the Bulgin connector using the table in step 3 as a guide.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ Some relay control boards such
as [this](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Channel-Optocoupler-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B01HEQF5HU/ref=asc_df_B01HEQF5HU/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198076677096&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5997956897740931812&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9027902&hvtargid=pla-350609711896&psc=1)
on Amazon are ACTIVE on LOW. This means that the signal provided by the Raspberry Pi (a higher voltage) to activate a
relay will instead turn the relay off. While this can be changed in the code, please consider purchasing HIGH level
trigger (
e.g [the board specified in the parts list](https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-4-channel-12v-relay-module/p/XC4440))
or adjustable trigger (
e.g. [this board](https://www.amazon.com/DZS-Elec-Optocoupler-Isolation-Triggered/dp/B07BDJJTLZ/ref=asc_df_B07BDJJTLZ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241912880102&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5997956897740931812&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9027902&hvtargid=pla-438273746158&psc=1)).

Next, connect red and black jumper wires to the VCC and GND header pins on the relay control board. Now choose one Wago
block to be a 12V positive block and the second to be the negative or ground. To the positive block, connect the 12 V
wire from the fuse (12V input from source), the 12 V input to the voltage regulator, the 12 V solenoid line from the
relay board and the VCC line from the relay board to one of the two WAGO terminal blocks, twisting the wires together if
necessary. Repeat with the second, negative WAGO terminal block, connecting the input ground line from the Bulgin
connector, ground line from the voltage regulator and the GND black wire from the relay board.

### Step 6 - mounting Raspberry Pi and connecting power

Attach the Raspberry Pi to the 3D printed mount using 2.5 mm standoffs. Install in the raised slots in the OWL base.
Connect to micro USB power from the voltage regulator, using a micro USB to USB-C adaptor. Alternatively, the Raspberry
Pi can be powered over the GPIO, however, this has not yet been implemented.

### Step 7 - connecting GPIO pins

Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO to the relay control board header pins, using the table below and the wiring diagram above
as a guide:

The GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi are not clearly labelled, so use this guide to help. Be careful when connecting these
pins as incorrect wiring can shortcircuit/damage your Pi.

### Step 8 - mounting and connecting camera

Connect one end of the CSI ribbon cable to the camera. We provide a mounting plate that can be used with both the HQ, Global Shutter or
V2 cameras, however, we recommend the use of the HQ camera for improved image clarity. Attach the HQ camera to the 3D
printed mount using 2.5 mm standoffs (or 2 mm standoffs if using the V2 camera). Ensuring that the CSI cable port on the
camera is directed towards the Raspberry Pi, mount the camera inside the OWL case using four M3 standoffs (50 mm long
for HQ camera; 20 mm long for V2 camera). Connect the other end of the CSI cable to the Raspberry Pi CSI camera port.

Before connecting the lens, please be aware the HQ camera comes with fitted a C-CS mount adapter which needs to be
removed before fitting the 6mm lens. The image won't focus unless the adapter is removed. More information is available
below and in the [HQ Camera Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/hq-camera/cs-mount-lens-guide.pdf)

How to remove the C-CS mount adapter:

The HQ lens will need to be focused, details below, once the software is correctly set up.

### Step 9 - adding buzzer and LEDs

Mount the buzzer inside the OWL base using double sided mounting tape and connect the 5 V and ground wires to Raspberry
Pi GPIO pins 7 and 9, respectively.

For simplicity we have used two 12V LEDs (which are just normal LEDs with a current limiting resistor included) for both
the 5V TX/GND connection for Raspberry Pi status indication and also the 12V power connection. While 12 V will work fine
on both, the 5 V connection will be dimmer. If you want to use a non-prepackaged, 3 mm LED for the 5V connection, you
should solder a current limiting resistor to the LED to prevent damage to either the LED or the Rasperry Pi as
described [here](https://howchoo.com/g/ytzjyzy4m2e/build-a-simple-raspberry-pi-led-power-status-indicator). Install the
5 V LED inside the OWL base and connect the 5V and ground wire to GPIO pins 8 (TX pin) and 20 (GND pin), respectively.
Install the 12 V LED inside the OWL base and connect the 12 V and GND wires to their respective WAGO terminal blocks.

### OPTIONAL STEP - adding real time clock module

Although optional, we recommend that you use a real time clock (RTC) module with the OWL system. This will enable the
Raspberry Pi to hold the correct time when disconnected from power and the internet, and will be useful for debugging
errors if they arise. The RTC uses a CR1220 button cell battery and sits on top of the Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins 1-6.

### Step 10 - connecting mounting hardware and OWL cover

There are four 6.5 mm holes on the OWL base for mounting to a boom. Prior to installing the OWL cover, decide on a
mounting solution suitable to your needs. In the photo below, we used 4 x M6 bolts. The cover of the OWL unit is secured
with 4 x M3 nuts and bolts. Place M3 nuts into the slots in the OWL base. This can be fiddly and we suggest using
tweezers, as shown below. Place the cover onto the base and secure using M3 bolts.

<summary> Compact OWL - Hardware Assembly</summary>
<br>

One major benefit of the Compact OWL (with the OWL driver board) is that no soldering is required. The design removes 
much of the wiring, improving ease of assembly and reliability. If you choose a Raspberry Pi Relay HAT instead of the 
OWL driver board, you'll just need to add a voltage regulator and solder that in to provide the 5V @ 5A required for 
the Raspberry Pi 5 or up to 3A required for the older models.

There are two options for the enclosure. The 3D printed enclosure and the official OWL extruded aluminium enclosure. Both share
a 3D printed tray and the same components. The 3D printed version allows you to make a start without needing to buy bespoke
components if you have access to a 3D printer.

The 3D model files for the printed enclosure can be downloaded [here]().

The Official OWL Enclosure will be available for purchase through the OWL store soon.

### Step 1 - enclosure, camera and mounts
The internal tray is the same for both the extruded aluminium or 3D printed enclosures. The 3D printed tray suits the
Raspberry Pi HQ Camera and the Global Shutter Camera. A separate mount is available for the Camera Module 3. Details are
provided below.

Begin camera installation by removing the adapter ring and fitting the lens. The camera will not focus with this 
ring.

| Global Shutter camera with adapter ring atached                                                                                 | Adapter ring removed                                                                                                    |

Mount the camera to the front of the tray using M2.5 standoffs. The Global Shutter camera requires slightly longer
standoffs to get past the plastic backing cover. Run the ribbon cable over the top of the tray (as pictured)

Once the camera is secured, mount the Raspberry Pi using 4 x M2.5 x 5mm long standoffs. To secure the Pi, use 4 x 15mm 
standoffs. These will be used to mount the HAT.

#### 3D printed enclosure
The 37 mm UV lens filter is installed on the faceplate with 8 M2 heat-set threaded inserts and M2 hex head screws. Add
the 1.6mm nitrile rubber o-ring cord to the internal channel on the lens mount. Firmly press the 37 mm UV lens filter into the 
channel on the faceplate.

Tighten down the 8 M2 screws in a cross pattern (similar to how a car tyre is installed), to avoid cracking the 3D printed
mount.

The 3D printed enclosure also supports the mounting of the Camera Module 3 with an extra 3D printed part. Using M2 threaded 
inserts in the faceplate, mount the plate with approx. 5mm long M2 standoffs. Route the camera ribbon cable over the top.

### Step 2 - connecting the Official OWL HAT
The OWL Hat simply fits over the GPIO pins and is mounted using the 4 x 15 mm standoffs installed in the previous step.
Secure the HAT with 4 x 2.5mm screws and tighten down.

PWM or GPIO control is selected with four jumper pins (in blue below). 

| Fitted Official OWL HAT                                                                                                  | OWL Hat jumpers                                                                                                               | GPIO pin assignment                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![mounted owl hat](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/d080805a-507f-4d9a-a363-25124c52c101) | ![20240502_123112_crop](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/ad1e522f-316b-4bc3-90c7-4415e5608205) | ![20240502_123121_crop](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/8a567873-0c5e-4c46-ba97-c6dbc0a2d352) |

The default option is for GPIO control as pictured. By default the OWL HAT is wired as shown above:

```ini
[Relays]
# defines the relay ID (left) that matches to a boardpin (right) on the Pi.
# Only change if you rewire/change the relay connections.
0 = 13
1 = 15
2 = 16
3 = 18
```
The final jumper pin `Pi Power Supply Enable` connects the Raspberry Pi to the 5V provided by the HAT. Only connect this jumper once you want the 
Pi to start.

#### Step 2a - connecting a generic relay HAT

Instead of the Official OWL HAT, a relay control HAT (such as [this from PiHut](https://core-electronics.com.au/pirelay-v2-relay-board-for-raspberry-pi-1.html?))
can be used, with some minor changes to the OWL software. There are many different relay HATs available, so check which
is most suitable for your purposes. Be sure to choose one with accessible GPIO pins.

Fit the HAT as recommended by the manufacturer, similar to the below images (source: The PiHut).

| HAT | Installed HAT |
|-----|---------------|
| ![image](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/bf16cf89-0955-4822-8a8a-c3bd7c295c7f)   |    ![image](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/4c0987a7-936f-4338-ac72-6ee352bc2636)           |

In its default configuration, this specific relay HAT assigns GPIO boardpins 29, 31, 33, and 35 to relays 4 - 1
respectively. This differs to the default OWL configuration, so the `[Relays]` section of the config file would need to
be updated. Using this board as the example:

```ini
[Relays]
# defines the relay ID (left) that matches to a boardpin (right) on the Pi.
# Only change if you rewire/change the relay connections.
0 = 35
1 = 33
2 = 31
3 = 29
```
 However, if you use another relay HAT check the assignment/configuration of relays to boardpins. For reference, use this
 GPIO guide to help.

</p>

#### Step 2b - connecting the voltage regulator
Without the OWL HAT, 5V power to Pi needs to be supplied separately. We recommend the [Pololu 5V 5.5A step down voltage
regulator](https://core-electronics.com.au/pololu-5v-5-5a-step-down-voltage-regulator-d36v50f5.html), however, 
there are many options available.

Solder wires to the input and output of the voltage regulator. Using WAGO connector blocks, connect the input to the 12V
from the Amphenol connector. Mount the regulator to the underside of the internal tray using M2 standoffs.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/b939e26f-1785-4d4e-8476-ec5721526724" width="400">
</p>

##### Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4B
The earlier models of the Raspberry Pi consumer less power (3A @ 5V) than the Raspberry Pi 5 and can be powered over single 5V and GND
pins on the GPIO. Use high quality connectors here or consider soldering directly to the GPIO pins on the HAT. A good
connection without risk of coming loose, is critical.

You'll need to solder to pins 2 (5V) and 6 (GND) on the relay HAT. More details provided 
[here](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-do-i-power-my-raspberry-pi) from The PiHut (image source).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/c8eeacde-0e6c-4de2-8120-a343cdcbc756" width="400">
</p>

##### Raspberry Pi 5
The Raspberry Pi 5 consumes up to 5A @ 5V, so it's suggested to use 2 x 5V and 2 x GND pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Some good information on the topic is provided [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=367896).

Using the two 5V outputs from the voltage regulator, solder one +5V wire to pin 2 and another to pin 4 on the GPIO on 
the HAT relay. Similarly, connect two GND wires from the voltage regulator output to pins 30 and 34. Ensure there is a 
good solder connection, without any short circuits to neighbouring pins.

The images below are from a Raspberry Pi 5, however, the setup is the same for the 4B and 3B+ models just with one 5V/GND
wire.

### Step 3 - wiring the connector and HAT
Begin by wiring the [Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius receptacle](https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Amphenol-SINE-Systems/FLS710N3W3S03?qs=ulEaXIWI0c8tWp%252BkBCr3Ag%3D%3D). The connector has 3 x 16 guage connections rated to 13A and 3 x 20 
guage rated up to 7.5A (machined) or 5A (stamped). Use the appropriate crimp connections for the 16 and 20 guage connections. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/e6ae15b0-cec5-4295-aa66-dbe5f731cc4b" height="300">
</p>

Connections are labeled A - F on the receptacle and should be made in the following order:

1. +12V (red) - A
2. GND (black) - E
3. relay 1 (blue) - B
4. relay 2 (green) - C
5. relay 3 (orange) - D
6. relay 4 (white) - F

Unlike the relay HATs and relay board in the Original OWL, the common ground for the OWL driver board is routed through 
the board itself, reducing the wiring required. Connect the wires from the back of the connector to each relay, 
using the above list as a guide. The finished result should appear similar to the images below. Add heat shrink at 
the end of each wire for neater and more reliable connections.

| Connector with wires                                                                                                          | Completed HAT                                                                                                                     | Completed HAT mounted on the Pi                                                                                        |

>**OPTIONAL** Add a 5V buzzer inside the OWL by mounting it to the corner of the HAT with a screw. Connect the 5 V and ground wires 
to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins 7 and 9, respectively. The buzzer is useful for identifying when the OWL has started successfully.
It isn't essential to operation.

>**OPTIONAL** Add Kapton tape to the camera cable and internal wiring. Kapton tape is a god insulator and resistant to high
temperatures, improving the robustness of the device.

| Tray with Kapton tape                                                                                                         |

### Step 4 - inserting the tray and closing the device
>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ For software installation, you'll need access to the Raspberry Pi display, and USB ports. We recommend you
set up the software prior to completing the build and inserting the tray. Alternatively, flash the SD card with one of 
the provided owl disk images.

To improve the resistance to dust and water ingression on the 3D printed version, you'll need to add a 3mm nitrile rubber 
o-ring around the face- and backplates of the enclosure.

| Faceplate with o-ring                                                                                                    | Backplate with o-ring                                                                                                   |

Fix the faceplate to the enclosure with the 4 x M4 screws. The 3D printed enclosure will need 4 x M4 threaded inserts set
into the plastic on the back and front of the enclosure body. Carefully push the tray into the enclosure on the second row,
making sure wires are not caught up on the side.

<p align="center">

</p>

For the single Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius receptacle, push it through the backplate and tighten down. Fix the backplate
to the enclosure.

There is a choice of three different backplates, depending on your hardware requirements. They include:
1. 1 x hole for the Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius
2. 2 x holes for the Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius and Adafruit waterproof RJ45 (ethernet) connector
3. 1 x 16mm hole for a 16mm cable gland.

If you would prefer a different arrangement, just get in touch or raise an issue and we can sort it out for you!

<summary> Connecting Solenoids for Spot Spraying</summary>
<br>

### Optional Step - connecting 12V solenoids

Once you have completed the setup, you now have the opportunity to wire up your own solenoids for spot spraying,
targeted tillage, spot flaming or any other targeted weed control you can dream up. To do this, wire the GND wire of
your device (it can be any wire if it's a solenoid) to the ground pin on the Bulgin plug (the same wire used for the GND
from the 12V power source) and wire the other to one of the blue, green, orange or white wires on pins 1 - 4. A wiring
diagram is provided below. The easiest way to wire them together to the same GND wire is to create a six-way harness,
where one end is connected to the plug, one of the five other wires to the source power GND and the remaining four to
the solenoids or whatever devices you are driving.

![solenoid wiring-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40649348/156698481-3d4fec4e-567a-4a18-b72e-b26d35c8d1c7.png)

### SBC Options

A single board computer or SBC is the brains behind the OWL. It can do all the image processing and logic within a
single, roughly credit card sized board without moving parts. These SBCs are the backbone of embedded computing or 'edge
computing'. While the Raspberry Pi is arguably one of the most widely used and well supported SBCs there are many
different options out there. Each has their strengths and weaknesses and may or may not be good fits with the OWL. We've
providing a summary of some SBCs below, but this isn't an exhaustive list.

Currently, only Raspberry Pi 5, 4 and 3B+ work with the OWL and have been tested in full. Early tests (alpha) have been
made with the LibreComputer LePotato. We will update the 'Works with OWL' column as more boards are tested in the
community.

Only the Raspberry Pi 5 is currently capable of operating on larger image sizes. Frame rates of up to 120 FPS were recorded at the
default 416 x 320 resolution. We recommend increasing resolution to 640 x 480 for the Raspberry Pi 5.

Want to help fill in this table? Find one of the untested platforms and give the OWL a go!

NVIDIA has released numerous powerful, [embedded computers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/) such as
the Jetson Orin series (and previously the Jetson Xavier NX). These would likely be good options for the OWL, but are
substantially more expensive than the options listed above.

</details>

# Software
Installing the OWL software is straightforward and can be automated for a simple, two-line install. Alternatively, you can
take the step-by-step alternative to see what is happening under the hood.

Both begin by flashing the latest Raspbian operating system to an SD card and booting up a Raspberry Pi.

Steps:
1. Set up Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi
2. Either the **Two-line installation** (10 mins) OR **Detailed installation** (60 mins)

The project will eventually support the use of the two major embedded computing devices, the Raspberry Pi (models 3B+, 4 and 5)
and the Jetson Nano/Jetson Xavier NX for possible green-on-green detection with deep learning algorithms. At
present, just the details on setting up the Raspberry Pi 3B+/4/5 are provided below. There are two options for
installation.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ 08/05/2024 - OWL transitioned from `picamera` to `picamera2` support. The v1.0.0 disk image below (Buster) does not
support `picamera2` and will not work on the Raspberry Pi 5 nor with the recent camera releases. We strongly recommend
using the most up to date version of Raspbian with the latest OWL software.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ 17/03/2023 - running of the OWL changed from using `greenonbrown.py` to `owl.py`. This
ensures better cross compatibility with GoG algorithms. It improves the modularity of the system.

<details>
<summary><b>Step 1: Raspbian Installation</b></summary>
<br>

### Step 1 - Raspberry Pi setup

#### Step 1a - Rasperry Pi OS
Before powering up the Raspberry Pi, you'll need to install the Raspian operating system (just like Windows/MacOSX for
laptops) on the new SD card. This is done using the same process as the quick method used to flash the premade owl.img
file, except you'll be doing it with a completely new and untouched version of Raspbian. 

From your own computer, download and flash the latest **64-bit** version of Raspian from the official 
[Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) to the empty SD card. 
The official [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) is a good piece of software to use.

Leave the hostname as default. To simplify setup, you can specify the wifi network settings. Set the username to 'owl'
and choose a password.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Step 1b - Setting up the OWL
Once the Raspian OS has been flashed to the SD Card (may take 5 - 10 minutes), remove the SD card and insert it into the
Raspberry Pi. Connect the screen, keyboard and mouse and then power up the Pi.

Alternatively, you can SSH into your OWL from a separate device and install it remotely. A good guide on how to do that is 
available [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-ssh-into-raspberry-pi-remote/). 

##### First boot
On the first boot you may be asked to set country, timezone, keyboard, connect to wifi and look for updates among other
things. If you haven't already set the username, set it to 'owl' and choose a password. Uninstall the unused browser - 
this will save space on the Pi. Finally, you will be asked to restart the pi.

##### Opening terminal
After the restart, open up Terminal. You can press CTRL + ALT + T, or click the icon in the top left with the `>_` 
symbol. The instructions that follow are a blend of those available from 
[PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/16/install-opencv-4-on-raspberry-pi-4-and-raspbian-buster/) 
and [QEngineering](https://qengineering.eu/bookworm.html)

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ All commands below are provided for easy copy/paste. When using terminal you should see `owl@raspberrypi:~ $`
> at the start of each line and `(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $` when operating within the `owl` virtual environment. Pay very close
> attention to the presence/absence of `(owl)` in front of each line, as this can make/break installation.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ We recommend naming the device `owl` when asked if you didn't set it during the flashing process.

<summary><b>Step 2: Quick method for software installation</b></summary>
<br>

## Step 2: Quick Method - Two-line install
>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️: *Two line install is suitable for the Raspberry Pi 5 and Bookworm Raspberry Pi OS.*

#### Two-line Install
If you prefer a faster and simpler installation, try the following two-line install. You'll first need to clone the owl repository
before running `owl_setup.sh`. 

To start, clone the Github repository:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator owl
```
With the repository cloned into the 'owl' folder, we can now run the bash script `owl_setup.sh`. This will take some time
to complete

```commandline
bash owl/owl_setup.sh
```
Once completed successfully, your OWL is ready to go and you only need to focus the camera. You should see a table at the
end similar to the following:

```bash
Installation Summary:
🟢 [OK] System Upgrade
🟢 [OK] Camera Detected
🟢 [OK] Camera Test
🟢 [OK] Virtual Environment Created
🟢 [OK] OpenCV Installed
🟢 [OK] OWL Dependencies Installed
🟢 [OK] Boot Scripts Moved
```

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ If you use this method, you can finish the installation here. The following steps just go through what is 
> in the `owl_setup.sh` script step-by-step. We recommend the step-by-step approach if you want to become more familiar
> with how the OWL works.

### Focusing the camera

The final step in the process is to make sure the camera is correctly focused for the mounting height. With the latest
software, when you run `owl.py --focus` a sharpness (i.e. least blurry) estimation is provided on the video feed. The
algorithm determines how sharp an image is, so the higher the value the better. 

| Blurry Image | Clear Image |
|--------------|-------------|

<summary><b>Step 2: Detailed OWL installation procedure</b></summary>
<br>

## Detailed Method
**IMPORTANT**: *Suitable for the Raspberry Pi 5 and Bookworm Raspberry Pi OS.*

This setup approach may take a little longer (aproximately 1 hour total) than the quick method, but you'll be much better
trained in the ways of OWL and more prepared for any problem solving, upgrades or changes in the future. You'll also
download and use the latest software that hasn't been saved in the .img file yet. In the process you'll learn about
Python environments, install Python packages and set it all up to run on startup. To get this working you'll need access
to:

* Raspberry Pi
* Empty SD Card (SanDisk 32GB SDXC ideally)
* Your own computer with SD card reader
* Power supply (if not using the OWL unit)
* Screen and keyboard
* WiFi/Ethernet cable

#### Step-by-step install
Instead of the two-line installation, the following procedure details all steps required.

##### Free up space
The Raspberry Pi comes pre-installed with a range of software. To free up space it can be removed from the OWL. 
Depending on your install, these may or may not be present. At the command line (it should look like `owl@raspberrypi:~ $`), 
run the following:
```commandline
sudo apt-get purge wolfram-engine
```
```commandline
sudo apt-get purge libreoffice*
```
```commandline
sudo apt-get clean
```

##### Set up the virtual environment
A virtual environment contains all the necessary packages in one neat spot. We'll be using `virtualenv` and 
`virtualenvwrapper` on the Pi to create a virtual environment called `owl`.

To start with, update the system. The update may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection and how many
packages need updating. It's good practice to do this regularly. Then you'll add the following two lines to the `bashrc`
file.

Begin by updating the system:
```commandline
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Then add the following lines to the `.bashrc` file to prepare for the creation of virtual environments.
```commandline
echo "# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```commandline
echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Finally, reload the `.bashrc` file.
```commandline
source ~/.bashrc
```
Once that is complete, you can install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` and add a few more lines to the same `bashrc`
file.
```commandline
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv
```
```commandline
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenvwrapper
```
Following the installation of these packages, add the following lines to the `.bashrc` file.
```commandline
echo "export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```commandline
echo "source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
As above, reload the file to update the changes.
```commandline
source ~/.bashrc
```
With the virtual environment software successfully installed, it's now time to create the `owl` environment. Importantly,
we need to inherit the site-packages (i.e. everything currently on the Pi) because they contain `picamera2` pre-installed.

To make the `owl` environment, run the following:
```commandline
mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages -p python owl
```
The command line should now look like `(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $`. The '(owl)' at the start of the line means you're currently within
that virtual environment. To turn it off you can run `deactivate` and to turn it run `workon owl`.

**IMPORTANT**: The next steps must be run within the `owl` virtual environment. We're installing packages specific to the OWL.

### Step 2 - Installing packages
We now need to install the Python libraries that let the OWL work. The most import is OpenCV, which we'll do first before
downloading the OWL repository and installing the remainder from the `requirements.txt` file. Begin by ensuring the `owl`
environment is active.

>⚠️**WARNING**⚠️ It is ESSENTIAL that `(owl)` is present at the start of each line in terminal for this section. The `(owl)`
> indicates that you are within the `owl` virtual environment and that these Python packages will be installed and accessible
> within this environment. Run `workon owl` to ensure you are in the `owl` environment.

```commandline
workon owl
```
Now that you are in the `owl` virtual environment we can begin installing packages.
```commandline
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```
This should have successfully installed OpenCV into the `owl` virtual environment. You can double check by quickly starting a
Python session at the command line:
```commandline
python
```
This will open up an interactive Python session (indicated by >>>) from which you should type:

```commandline
>>> import cv2
>>> import picamera2
>>> exit()
```
This should then exit you from the Python session. The command line should look like this:

```commandline
(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $
```

If both of these complete without error, then you've successfully set up the virtual environment and installed OpenCV.

### Step 3 - Downloading the 'owl' repository

Now you should have:

* A virtual environment called 'owl'
* A working version of OpenCV installed into that environment
* a Terminal window open with the 'owl' environment activated.

The next step is to download the entire OpenWeedLocator repository into your *home* directory on the Raspberry Pi. First
change into the home directory:

```commandline
cd ~
```
then clone the repository 'https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator' into a new folder called 'owl'
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator owl
```
This will download the repository into a folder called `owl`. Double check it is there by typing `(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $ ls` 
and reading through the results, alternatively open up the Home folder using a mouse. If that was successful, you can 
now move on to Step 4.

### Step 4 - Installing the OWL Python dependencies
Dependencies are Python packages on which the code relies to function correctly. With a range of versions and possible
comptibility issues, this is the step where issues might come up. There aren't too many packages, but please make sure
each and every module in the requirements.txt file has been installed correctly. These include:

* OpenCV (should already be in 'owl' virtual environment from Step 1)
* numpy
* imutils
* gpiozero
* pandas
* RPi.GPIO
* tqdm
* blessed (for command line visualisation)
* threading, multiprocessing, collections, queue, time, os (though these are included as standard Python modules).

>⚠️**IMPORTANT**⚠️ Before continuing make sure you are in the `owl` virtual environment. Check that `(owl)` appears at the start
of each command line, e.g. `(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $`. Run `workon owl` if you are unsure. If you are not in the `owl`
environment, you will run into errors when starting `owl.py`.

To install all the requirements.txt, change into the owl directory:

```commandline
cd ~/owl
```

then run:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now to double-check this has worked, we can open up another Python session and try importing the packages. Begin by typing:

```commandline
python
```
Python should start up an interactive session; type each of these in and make sure you don't get any errors.

```commandline
>>> import cv2
>>> import numpy
>>> import gpiozero
>>> import pandas
```
Version numbers can be checked with:

```commandline
>>> print(package_name_here.__version__) ## this is a generic example - add the package where it says package_name_here
>>> print(cv2.__version__)
>>> exit()
```
If any errors appear, you'll need to go back and check that the modules above have (1) been installed into the owl
virtual environment, (2) that Python was started in the owl environment, and/or (3) they all installed correctly. Once
that is complete, exit Python and continue with the installation process.

### Step 5 - starting OWL on boot

Now that these dependencies have been installed into the owl virtual environment, it's time to make sure the software 
runs on startup. The first step is to make both the Python file `owl.py` and the boot files `owl_boot.sh` and `owl_boot_wrapper.sh`
executable. Then move both `owl_boot.sh` and `owl_boot_wrapper.sh` into the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

```commandline
chmod a+x owl.py
```
```commandline
chmod a+x owl_boot.sh
```
```commandline
chmod a+x owl_boot_wrapper.sh
```
```commandline
sudo mv owl_boot.sh /usr/local/bin/owl_boot.sh
```
```commandline
sudo mv owl_boot_wrapper.sh /usr/local/bin/owl_boot_wrapper.sh
```

After they have been made executable, the `owl.py` needs to be launched on startup so each time the Raspberry Pi is
powered on, the detection systems starts. The easiest way to do this is by using cron, a scheduler for starting code. 
We need to add the `owl_boot.sh` file to the schedule so that it launches on boot. The `owl_boot.sh` file is 
fairly straightforward. It's what's known as a [bash script](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php) which is just a text file that
contains commands we would normally enter on the command line in Terminal.

This is the `owl_boot.sh` file:
```commandline
#!/bin/bash

# automatically determine the home directory, to avoid issues with username
source $HOME/.bashrc

# activate the 'owl' virtual environment
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/owl/bin/activate

# change directory to the owl folder
cd $HOME/owl

# run owl.py in the background and save the log output
LOG_DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ")
./owl.py > $HOME_DIR/owl/logs/owl_$LOG_DATE.log 2>&1 &
```

In the file, the first two commands launch our `owl` virtual environment, then we change directory `cd` into the owl 
folder and run the python program. The `owl_boot_wrapper.sh` file figures out which user is running the file, and then
uses that user to run `owl_boot.sh`. This makes the system more resilient to changes in Pi username.

To add this to the list of cron jobs, you'll need to edit it as a root user:

```commandline
sudo crontab -e
```

Select `1. /bin/nano editor`, which should bring up the crontab file. At the base of the file add this text:

```
@reboot /usr/local/bin/owl_boot_wrapper.sh > /home/launch.log 2>&1 
```

Once you've added that line, you'll just need to save the file and exit. In the nano editor just press Ctrl + X, then Y
and finally press Enter to agree to save and exit.

If you get stuck, [this guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-program-script-at-startup/) or [this guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/run-script-at-boot-raspberry-pi) both have a bit more detail on cron and some other methods too.

Now you'll just need to reboot the system. Once it reboots, `owl.py` will launch and run in the background.

### Step 6 - focusing the camera

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ *Cameras with automatic focus such as the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 will be automatically focused to 1.2m 
distance. The following guide is useful for the HQ and Global Shutter cameras which require manual focusing.*

The final step in the process is to make sure the camera is correctly focused for the mounting height. With the latest
software, when you run `owl.py --focus` a sharpness (i.e. least blurry) estimation is provided on the video feed. The
algorithm determines how sharp an image is, so the higher the value the better.

This will automate all the steps below. If this doesn't work, follow the steps below. If you would like to focus the OWL
again, you can always run `./owl.py --focus`.

| Blurry Image | Clear Image |
|--------------|-------------|
|![blurry owl](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/34ae71f2-8507-4892-b49a-195e515e56dd) | ![clear owl](https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/assets/51358498/20db536b-edaf-4085-a613-6ea786747998) |

#### Manual focusing

With the older versions of the software, you need to stop all `owl.py` background processes before
you can restart the software with the video feed viewable on the screen. Enter the following into the terminal:

```commandline
ps -C owl.py
```

After pressing ENTER, you should receive the following output:

```
(owl) owl@raspberrypi:~ $ ps -C owl.py
PID TTY              TIME CMD
515 ?            00:00:00 owl.py
```

The PID is the important part, it's the ID number for the `owl.py` program. In this case it is `515`, but it is likely
to be different on your OWL.

>⚠️**IMPORTANT**⚠️ If the headings `PID TTY              TIME CMD` appear but a PID/line for owl.py doesn't appear it could mean
two things. Firstly make sure you've typed `owl.py` correctly. If it doesn't have the right program to look for, it
won't find it. The other option is that `owl.py` isn't running, which may also be the case. If you're certain it's not
running in the background, skip the stop program step below, and move straight to launching `owl.py`.

If a PID appears, you'll need to stop it operating. To stop the program, enter the following command:

```commandline
sudo kill enter_your_PID_number_here
```

The program should now be stopped

Now you'll need to launch `owl.py` manually with the video feed visible. To do this use the Terminal window and type the
following commands:

```commandline
~/owl/./owl.py --show-display
```

This will bring up a video feed you can use to visualise the OWL detector and also use it to focus the camera. Once
you're happy with the focus, press Esc to exit.

### Step 8 - reboot

The moment of truth. Shut the Raspberry Pi down and unplug the power. This is where you'll need to reconnect the camera
and all the GPIO pins/power in the OWL unit if they have been disconnected. Once everything is connected again (double
check the camera cable is inserted or this won't work), reconnect the power and wait for a beep!

If you hear a beep, grab something green and move it under the camera. If the relays start clicking (the Official OWL 
HAT uses transistors and will not click - look for the lights) and lights come on, congratulations, you've successfully 
set the OWL up! If not, check the troubleshooting chart below and see if you can get it fixed. Raise an issue and get in touch
if you're not sure how to proceed.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ The unit does not perform well under office/artificial lighting. The thresholds have been set for outdoor
conditions.

The optional real time clock module can be set up by following the [detailed instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-up-and-test-i2c) provided by Adafruit. This is a quick process that should take less than 10 minutes. Note that an internet connection is required to set the time initially, however after this the time will be held on the clock module.

## Changing detection settings
<details>
<summary>Instructions for changing detection settings</summary>
<br>
Changing detection settings is now easier by using a specific config file. 

You can use command line flags to toggle display, data source and setting focus. Use the `config.ini` file in the 
config folder to set other parameters as described below.

The default config file is `DAY_SENSITIVITY_2.ini` (details provided below). If you change any settings here, make sure
to save the file before restarting `owl.py`. 

While we recommend tuning detection parameters to your specific environment, we have provided three sensitivity levels to 
get you started.

| Config File Name      | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DAY_SENSITIVITY_1.ini | The least sensitive parameters, designed to minimise false positive detections to just get the big weeds. Minimum detection size has been increased. |
| DAY_SENSITIVITY_2.ini | OWL detection parameters were tuned to this file.                                                                                                    |
| DAY_SENSITIVITY_3.ini | The most sensitive parameters. Reduce missed detections with lower minimum detection size and wider detection ranges.                                |


### Command line flags
Command line flags are let you specify options on the command line within the Terminal window. It means you don't have
to open up the code and make changes directly. OWL now supports the use of flags for some parameters. To read a
description of all flags available type `--help`:

```commandline
usage: owl.py [-h] [--input] [--show-display] [--focus]
  --input               path to image directory, single image or video file
  --show-display        show display windows
  --focus               focus the camera
```

### Creating your own config files
Feel free to create your own config files to meet your specific conditions. In `owl.py` just update the path to the
config file. Follow the same layout and format as the default.

To open `owl.py`, you'll need to open it and not execute the file. 

Navigate to the `owl` directory  | Open the `owl.py` file
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![owl_dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/221152779-46c78fe2-92e6-4e65-9ebd-234ae02c33f6.png) | ![open_greenonbrown_py](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/221153072-922d9ed6-8120-4c2d-9bd2-a999030b4723.png)

Then scroll down to the very bottom until you find the line below. Update the `config_file=` path to your own config file path.

```python
owl = Owl(config_file='config/ENTER_YOUR_CONFIG_FILE_HERE.ini')
```

These are the various system, data collection and detection settings that can be changed. They are defined further below.

## Connecting a Controller

<details>
<summary>Adding simple controllers to manage four OWLS or fewer</summary>
<br>

The software and designs for the first generation GPIO-based controllers (between 1 and 4 OWL units) are now available. 
This approach offers a simpler, hardware-based option for managing devices. However, it is more difficult to scale
and add features. Adressing this issue, a CAN FD-based controller is in development.

| Ute Controller                                                                                          | 'Advanced' Controller                                                                               |

NOTE: you MUST connect a USB drive when using a controller, otherwise it will not start. The [Sandisk Ultrafit Flash Drive](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B07857Y17V)
will fit within the enclosure.

#### Tools required
1. Crimping tool for Amphenol crimped connections
2. Pliers
3. Wire strippers/cutters
4. Soldering iron/solder

### Step 1 - Parts list
The parts lists below are provided as a guide only. Please use local suppliers and search around for items that may have
equivalent specifications but lower price or faster delivery.

As you increase the number of OWLs connected to the Advanced Controller, be sure to increase the current rating of all
relevant components. For systems with four OWLs, consider using a relay box (used in cars) to avoid running high current
cables over long distances and switching them inside a cab.

_Cable protection and sheaths_
Trailer cable already has a heavy duty outer covering, however a [Nylon Hose Protector](https://www.amazon.com/nylon-hose-sleeve/s?k=nylon+hose+sleeve) sleeve will increase the lifetime of 
cabling, without adding too much expense.

#### Ute Controller
Suitable for connecting a singular OWL device. TinkerCAD model available [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1s5gWD7wiJv-ute-controller).

#### Advanced Controller
Suitable for connecting up to four OWLs. As the number of OWLs connected increases, each switch should add another pole.
For four OWLs, you will need four pole switches and an input power cable (and switch) rating of at least 40A @ 12V 
(4 OWLs x 10A).

TinkerCAD models (1, 2, and 4 OWLs) available [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/e3JOeuyfLNO-advanced-owl-controller).

### Step 2 - Download and print the controller enclosure   
3D model files are available for both controller types. These could equally be set up quite easily in widely available
plastic enclosures available in your local area. It would simply require drilling holes to match switch dimensions.
Circular connectors and switches have been selected for this reason.

While the Ute Controller is designed to fit in a cupholder, the rear of the Advanced Controller has heat set embedded
nuts to mount a Ram Mount C-size round plate.

### Step 3 - Make connections
Connections to the switches can be either soldered and covered with heat shrink or connected with automotive-style blade
fittings (e.g. [these ones](https://dk.farnell.com/en-DK/multicomp/fdfd2-250/crimp-terminal-female-pk100/dp/9971904?gross_price=true&CMP=KNC-GDK-GEN-Shopping-Pmax-High-ROAS-Test-1333&mckv=_dc|pcrid||&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_qG5BhDTARIsAA0UHSK8XfPiID1ituCt987syg615fI81J2F7KvWkH7X24Wsv7TuShBox9waAh7oEALw_wcB))

LEDs should be carefully soldered and covered with heat shrink.

Crimp connections for the Amphenol Fathomlock connectors are most efficiently and reliably done with a crimping tool, but
can be crimped with pliers if necessary. Just be very careful to check the quality of the connection by tugging it gently.
Improperly crimped connections can cause hard to diagnose problems and/or heat up creating a fire risk.

Use the tables below to make the right connections. In both cases, only 6 of the 7 trailer cable wires are used. Cut the 7th
wire and carefully cover it in heatshrink to avoid it rubbing on the other wires. Alternatively find 6 core cable (7 core
trailer wire is just much easier to find/cheaper).

Carefully remove the outer protective coating of the trailer cable without damaging the sheaths of the wires inside. If
you do damage them (it's very easy to do) just use some heat shrink to cover the cut. Remove about 10cm of the outer sheath.

#### Ute controller
Use one of the M12 glands for the 12V power in from the cigarette socket (or otherwise) and the other for the trailer cable.
Push the 6 internal wires from the trailer cable through the M12 cable gland and make the following connections:
1. Connect a black wire to the centre of the REC toggle switch and the shorter pin on the two 5V red LEDs (not the 12V green one).
Bundle these wires together with a WAGO block or solder and heatshrink them with the BROWN trailer wire. This will be the GPIO GND.
2. Connect the WHITE wire to the recording/detection toggle switch.
3. Connect the GREEN wire to the longer pin of the REC red LED.
4. Connect the YELLOW wire to the longer pin of the MEM LED (storage status indicator)

Push the cigarette light wires through the other M12 gland. Connect the RED wire to the top, power switch. On the other
leg of the switch solder a 10A rated wire (for the OWL) and a smaller gauge wire for the 12V LED pin. Connect the 10A rated wire from the switch
to the RED wire from the trailer cable. The 12V black GND wire can be connected directly to the BLACK wire of the trailer
cable, adding a black smaller gauge wire for the 12V LED.

On the OWL end of the cable, make the following connections using the 6-pin receptacle. Use the connector pin map for the plug end
of the trailer cable. Take care that the connector pins on the receptacle and the plug match.

| Purpose                                     | Colour | GPIO Pin                                 | Connector Pin (size)  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Power +12V                                  | Red    | N/A - connect to 12V of OWL Driver Board | A (#16)               |
| Power GND                                   | Black  | N/A - connect to GND of OWL Driver Board | B (#16)               |
| Recording/Detection Toggle Switch           | White  | BOARD 37                                 | C (#16)               |

| Storage status indicator                    | Yellow | BOARD 40                                 | E (#20)               |
| GPIO GND                                    | Brown  | BOARD 39                                 | F (#20)  (centre pin) |

Cover the trailer cable in a nylon sheath if needed.

#### Advanced controller
The same principles apply for the advanced controller. Power is carried by the separate power wire instead of through the 
trailer cable. A single status LED is needed per OWL for indicating errors, detections and available storage capacity.

Multi-pole toggle switches are used to avoid interference between each of the Raspberry Pi in the OWLs.

Use the table below and connect the correct colour wire with the correct switch. Use a single GPIO GND line for each OWL
ensuring this is separate to the 12V GND.

| Purpose            | Colour                        | GPIO Pin                                 | Connector Pin (size) |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Power +12V         | Red (use additional cable)    | N/A - connect to 12V of OWL Driver Board | A (#16)              |
| Power GND          | Black (use additional cable)  | N/A - connect to GND of OWL Driver Board | B (#16)              |
| All nozzles on     | Blue (trailer cable)          | BOARD 36                                 | C (#16)              |
| Recording toggle   | Green (trailer cable)         | BOARD 38                                 | D (#16)              |
| Sensitivity toggle | Yellow/Orange (trailer cable) | BOARD 40                                 | E (#16)              |
| Status LED         | White (trailer cable)         | BOARD 37                                 | F (#16)              |
| Spot spray enable  | Red (trailer cable)           | BOARD 35                                 | G (#16)              |
| GPIO GND           | Brown  (trailer cable)        | BOARD 39                                 | H (#16) (centre pin) |

### Step 4 - Add heatset inserts and finish enclosure

Using a soldering iron on a low setting or specifically designed tools, carefully add the M3 and M5 heatset inserts for the 
top cover and the Ram Mount round plate respectively Ensure the inserts are correctly aligned, straight and flush with the
surface of the controller.

### Step 5 - Update config file

The following parameters are used to change controller settings under the controller section of the `config.ini` file. 
Choose which controller (or 'None') by using None, ute or advanced.

For the Ute Controller, the toggle switch can be used for either toggling recording or detection. Select this mode here.

For the Advanced Controller, the low and high sensitivity files that are switched between with the sensitivity switch can be adjusted
with paths specified in `low_sensitivity_config` and `high_sensitivity_config`.

```ini
[Controller]
# choose between 'None', 'ute' or 'advanced'
controller_type = None

# for advanced controller
detection_mode_pin_up = 35
detection_mode_pin_down = 36
recording_pin = 38
sensitivity_pin = 40
low_sensitivity_config = config/DAY_SENSITIVITY_2.ini
high_sensitivity_config = config/DAY_SENSITIVITY_3.ini

# for UteController
switch_purpose = recording
switch_pin = 37
```
NOTE: you MUST connect a USB drive when using a controller, otherwise it will not start.

With the config files set, save them to the OWL, reboot, and you should be ready to go!

## Green‑on‑Green (In‑Crop) Detection – *Beta*

> **Status:** early beta – APIs and install steps may change. Feedback welcome!

The *Green‑on‑Green* (GoG) module enables the Open Weed Locator (OWL) to spot weeds **inside the crop canopy**, where traditional green‑on‑brown vision fails.

### How It Works
GoG is a pluggable detector that chooses the fastest hardware it finds at runtime:

| Priority | Accelerator | Model type | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | **Hailo‑8 / 8L** | `.hef` | Pi 5 + Hailo‑8L M.2 HAT+ or x86 PCIe card. Best FPS & lowest power. |
| 2 | CPU (TFLite) | `.tflite` | Always available but slow – good for bench tests. |
| 3 | Coral Edge‑TPU | `.tflite` (Edge‑TPU compiled) | Requires Python ≤ 3.9; *PyCoral* wheels not yet built for Pi OS Bookworm (Py 3.11). |

Override auto‑selection with `--accel hailo|coral|cpu`.

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1 · Clone & set‑up OWL
$ git clone https://github.com/CropCrusaders/OpenWeedLocator.git owl && cd owl
$ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt   # core + TFLite

# 2 · Add your compiled GoG model & labels
$ mkdir -p models && cp ~/my_gog/best.{hef,tflite} models/
$ cp ~/my_gog/labels.txt           models/

# 3 · Run a smoke test (camera preview)
$ python owl.py --algorithm gog --accel auto --show-display
```

> **Need a model?** The *models/README* gives step‑by‑step recipes to **train**, **quantise**, and **compile** YOLOv8/YOLOv11 detectors for Hailo‑8L, Coral, or pure‑CPU. Start there if you don’t already have `best.hef` / `best.tflite`.

### Hardware & Driver Notes
* **Hailo‑8/8L** – install platform `hailo‑all >= 4.20` (supports Python 3.11). After `sudo reboot`, confirm with `hailortcli info`.
* **Coral Edge‑TPU** – create a **Python 3.9** venv (`pycoral` wheels stop at 3.9). Follow Coral USB/PCIe udev‑rules guide.

### Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `RuntimeError: Failed to open Hailo device` | Check cable/M.2 seating; ensure no other process is hogging the accelerator. |
| `ImportError: No module named 'pycoral'` on Pi OS Bookworm | Use Python 3.9 venv **or** switch to Hailo/CPU. |
| Camera preview flattened / stretched | Supply `--res W H` matching your sensor, or retrain model at native aspect. |
| Low FPS on CPU | Lower image size, prune model, or add Hailo 8L HAT+. |

### Training Your Own GoG Model
Full instructions live in **`models/README_green_on_green.md`**. It covers:
1. Image labelling (Label Studio, Weed‑AI datasets)
2. YOLO v8 / YOLO v11 training (Ultralytics)
3. Export → ONNX/TFLite
4. Compile for Hailo (`.hef`) or Edge‑TPU (`.tflite`) – including known export caveats.

## Non-Raspberry Pi Installation

<details>
<summary>Installing OWL software on a non-Raspberry Pi system</summary>
<br>
Using OWL software on your laptop/desktop or other non-Raspberry Pi system is a great way to test, develop and learn more about how it works. To start using the software, just follow the steps below. You will need access to virtual environments and your IDE/editor of choice. This method has been successfully tested on PyCharm with Anaconda environments.

```
> git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator
> cd OpenWeedLocator
```

For the next part, make sure you are in the virtual environment you will be working from. If you're unsure about virtual
environments, read
through [this PyImageSearch blog](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/25/configuring-ubuntu-for-deep-learning-with-python/)
on configuring an Ubuntu environment for deep learning - just skip to the virtual environment
step. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) has a great blog
describing them too.

Assuming the virtual environment is working and is activated, run through these next couple of steps:

```
> pip install -r non_rpi_requirements.txt     # this will install all the necessary packages, without including the Raspberry Pi specific ones.
```

It may take a minute or two for those to complete installing. But once they are done you are free to run the `owl.py`
software.

```
> python owl.py --show-display
```

From there you can change the command line flags (as described above) or play around with the settings to see how it
works.

# Image Processing

<details>
<summary>Image processing details and in-field results</summary>
<br>
So how does OWL actually detect the weeds and trigger the relay control board? It all starts by taking in the colour image from the camera using OpenCV and splitting it into its component channels: Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) (RGB) or loading and converting into the hue, saturation and value (HSV) colourspace. Following that, computer vision algorithms such as Excess Green `ExG = 2 * G - R - B` or thresholding type approaches on the HSV colourspace can be used to differentiate green locations from the background. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/152990324-d315672c-fb4b-42d2-b4df-363f702c473d.png)

Once the green locations are identified and a binary (purely black/white) mask generated, a contouring process is run to
outline each detection. If the detection pixel area is greater than the minimum area set in `minArea=10`, the central
pixel coordinates of that area are related to an activation zone. That zone is connected to a specific GPIO pin on the
Raspberry Pi, itself connected to a specific channel on the relay (one of IN1-4). When the GPIO pin is driven high (
activated) the relay switches and connects the solenoid for example to 12V and activates the solenoid. It's all
summarised below.

![OWL - workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/152990264-ddce7eb4-0e2e-4f98-ac77-bc2e535c5c54.png)

## Results

The performance of each algorithm on 7 different day/night fields is outlined below. The boxplot shows the range,
interquartile range and median performance for each algorithm. Whilst there were no significant differences (P > 0.05)
for the recall (how many weeds were detected of all weeds present) and precision (how many detections were actually
weeds), trends indicated the ExHSV algorithm was less sensitive (fewer false detections) and more precise, but did miss
more smaller/discoloured weeds compared to ExG.

![results boxplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/152990178-a53256c0-cfda-46d3-83c8-3ae018b4a40e.png)

The image below gives a better indication of the types of weeds that were detected/missed by the ExHSV algorithm. Large,
green weeds were consistently found, but small discoloured or grasses with thin leaves that blurred into the background
were missed. Faster shutter speed would help improve this performance.

# 3D Printing

<details>
<summary>3D printing instructions and files</summary>
<br>

## Original OWL
There are seven total items that need printing for the Original OWL unit. All items with links to the STL files are 
listed below. There are two options for Original OWL base:

1. Single connector (Bulgin) panel mount
    - Pros: of this method are easy/quick attach/detach from whatever you have connected, more water resistant.
    - Cons: more connections to make, more expensive
2. Cable gland
    - Pros: fewer connections to make, cheaper, faster to build.
    - Cons: more difficult to remove, less water resistant.

We also provide a link to the [3D models on TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fhfUCsPEn5q), an online and free
3D modelling software package, allowing for further customisation to cater for individual user needs.

**Update 02/05/2022**

* improved camera mounts
* space for 40mm lens cover
* more compact design
* version tracking

## Compact OWL
The Compact OWL has fewer parts to print than the Original OWL and is both more durable and water resistant. A complete
unit requires printing of only 5 parts.

All 3D model files are availabe on to edit and download on [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/id1FMJrWtJp-compact-owl) or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/875853-raspberry-pi-rugged-imaging-enclosure). 
The 3D printing .stl files are provided under the 3D Models and through the links in the table below.

The backplate comes in three options:
1. Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius receptacle only
2. Amphenol EcoMate Aquarius receptacle + Adafruit RJ45 waterproof ethernet connector
3. 16mm cable gland only

Pick one of these backplates when printing.

All .stl files for the 3D printed components of this build are available in the 3D Models directory.
Supports are not required but do improve print quality. All parts were printed with a Bambu Labs P1S at 0.16mm layer height
at 25% infill.

# Updating OWL

<details>
<summary>Updating OWL software</summary>
<br>

We and others will be continually contributing to and improving OWL as we become aware of issues or opportunities to
increase detection performance. Once you have a functioning setup the process to update is simple with a single bash script. 
First, you'll either need to connect a screen, keyboard and mouse to the OWL unit or do this via SSH.

>⚠️**IMPORTANT**⚠️ If you have made any changes to the config.ini files, these will be saved and copied across. You will
> be shown during this update process if changes have been made and where they will be kept.

The software can be updated using a one line bash script:
```
bash ~/owl/owl_update.sh
```

And that's it! You're good to go with the latest software.

If you have multiple units running, the most efficient method is to update one and then copy the SD card disk image to
every other unit. Follow the instructions presented here, to use software already installed on the Pi.

## Version History

All versions of OWL can be found here. Only major changes will be recorded as separate disk images for use.

|     Version     |                                  File                                  |       Raspbian       |

## Hardware

Here's a table of some of the common symptoms and possible explanations for errors we've come across. This is by no
means exhaustive, but hopefully helps in diagnosing any issues you might have. If you come across any others please
contact us so we can improve the software, hardware and guide.

>⚠️**NOTE**⚠️ If you are using the original disk image without updating, there are a number of issues that will appear. We
recommend updating to the latest software by following the procedure detailed in the [Updating OWL](#updating-owl)
section above.

To get more information, boot the Raspberry Pi with a screen connected, open up a Terminal window (Ctrl + T) and type `~/owl/./owl.py`. This will run the program. Check any errors that emerge.                      |
| Beep heard, but no relays activating when tested with green | Relays are not receiving (1) 12V power, (2) a signal from the Pi, (3) the Pi is not sending a signal | Check all your connections with a multimeter if necessary for the presence of 12V. Make sure everything is connected as per the wiring diagram. If you're confident there are no connection issues, open up a Terminal window (Ctrl + T) and type `~/owl/./owl.py`. This will run the program. Check any errors that emerge. |
