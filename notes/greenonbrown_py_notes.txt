Purpose: 
- Uses the colour thresholding algorithms from algorithms.py to perform weed 
  detection and labelling.
- It has only one class:
  - GreenOnBrown


Entrypoint:
- None. 


GreenOnBrown class:
- Called in owl.py by the hoot method of the Owl class.
- It has two methods:
  - __init__
  - inference

GreenOnBrown class --> __init__ method:
- Takes the chosen algorithm from algorithms.py as an input.
- Saves this as an attribute of the GreenOnBrown instance.

GreenOnBrown class --> inference method:
- Takes a BGR image as an input.
- Performs colour thresholding using the chosen algorithm. 
- Creates a kernel/structuring element that will be convolved with the image 
  during morphological operations to remove noise and isolate objects later.
- If the image returned by the colour thresholding algorithm is grayscale and 
  not binary, then a pixel-by-pixel binarisation is performed. 
  - Pixels with an intensity between exgMin and exgMax are kept.
  - All other pixels are set to a binary 0 (grayscale 0).
  - If show_display is enabled, the thresholded image is displayed.
  - Then an adaptive gaussian binarisation is applied to the thresholded image.
  - The threshold value is a gaussian-weighted sum of the neighbourhood values 
    (currently a 31x31 block centred on the pixel being analysed) minus the 
    constant C (currently set to 2).
  - Pixels that produce a value greater than zero are set to a binary 1 
    (grayscale 255), whilst pixels that produce a negative value are set to a 
    binary 0 (grayscale 0)
- Once the image is binary, a morphological closing operation is performed. 
  - This is equivalent to performing an erosion operation followed by an opening
    operation, which has the effect of closing small areas of white pixels 
    (noise) whilst leaving large areas of white pixels (objects) largly 
    unaffected.
- Then contour detection is performed, which finds the borders of every separate
  white blob in the binary image, as well as the hierarchy of the contours (one 
  border might be fully contained by another border like a donut).
- Them, for each contour:
  - It checks if the area enclosed by the contour is greater than a minimum 
    threshold. 
  - If it is, it computes the smallest bounding box that will contain the 
    contour, and then draws this bounding box on the image with a label "WEED".
  - It also saves the box start/end coordinates, and the box's centre.
- Finally, it returns the contours, the boxes, the box centres, and the labelled
  image.
