Purpose: 
- Uses a provided .tflite model to run weed detection and labelling.
- It has only one class:
  - GreenOnGreen


Entrypoint:
- None. 


GreenOnGreen class:
- Called in owl.py by the hoot method if 'gog' is selected as the algorithm.
- It has two methods:
  - __init__
  - inference

GreenOnGreen class --> __init__ method:
- Takes a labels.txt file path and a .tflite model file path as inputs.
- Attempts to import a .tflite model for green-on-green weed detection. 
  - If no directory is provided or no models are found at the specified 
    directory, prints a warning message to the terminal and attempts to load the 
    default model. 
    - If the default model is not found, prints a warning message.
    - If the default model is found, prints an info message.
  - If a model is found, prints an info message to the terminal with the name of
    the model being used.
  - If more than one model is found, uses the first one. 
- Once a model is found:
  - Reads the ./models/labels.txt file to determine the class being predicted.
  - Creates an instance of the TensorFlow Lite interpreter and points it to the
    model that it will be executing. 
  - Allocates memory for the interpreter's tensors so they can accept input data
    and generate output data.
  - Saves the size of the model's input/output for preprocessing to ensure that
    the size of incoming data matches the model's input.
  - Initialises an empty variable for storing the inference output.

GreenOnGreen class --> inference method:
- Takes a BGR image, a confidence threshold, and an object filter id as inputs.
- Converts the image from the BGR colour space to the RGB colour space. 
- Resizes the image to match the input size of the model. 
- Converts the image to byte data and feeds it to the inference model.
- Gets the detected objects from the output of the inference models that have a 
  confidence of at least the provided confidence threshold.
- Calculates x and y scaling factors to account for input image resizing.
- For each detected object that match the filter id (are weeds):
  - Scales the bounding box calculated by the inference model so that the box 
    coordinates match the original image resolution.
  - Calculates the centre of the bounding box (as the weed centre estimate).
  - Saves the starting coordinates, the centre coordinates, and the dimensions
    of the scaled bounding box.
  - Draws the bounding box on the original image with a text label of the 
    percentage confidence and the filter id. 
- Returns the boxes, centres, and the labelled image.
